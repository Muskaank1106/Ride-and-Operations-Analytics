# Ride-Booking Data Analysis | Business Analytics Project


## Overview  
This project analyzes 100,000+ ride-booking records to uncover business insights across revenue, cancellations, ratings, and customer behavior. Using real-world data, the project simulates a Business Analyst's role in solving operational problems for a ride-hailing company.  

It includes data cleaning in Excel, SQL queries to answer business questions, and five detailed Power BI dashboards to visualize:  
- Revenue by vehicle type and city  
- Cancellation reasons and patterns  
- Customer ratings across locations  
- Ride distribution by vehicle type  
- Overall KPIs and trends


## Business Objective  
To identify key patterns and operational inefficiencies affecting customer experience, revenue, and overall performance. This analysis focuses on solving real-world business questions related to ride performance, driver behavior, city-wise trends, and customer preferences.

- **Auto rides represent 35% of all cancellations**, primarily due to **driver unavailability (62%)**.  
- **Top 10 loyal customers account for 3.5% of total bookings**, showing potential for targeted loyalty campaigns.  
- **Metro cities (e.g., Bangalore, Mumbai) have an average rating of 3.8**, compared to **4.4 in smaller cities**.  
- **Booking volume increases by 42% on weekends**, with the peak time being **6 PM to 9 PM**.
